# 🧠 My DSA Problem Solving

This is **not just a collection of code** — it’s a journey of how I solve problems, reflect on mistakes, improve my logic, and master algorithmic thinking step by step.

I use this repo to document my:
- ❓ Understanding of the **problem statement**
- 🔎 Initial **brute-force** logic
- ⚠️ **Mistakes** or wrong assumptions I made
- 🔧 **Corrections** and **debugging steps**
- ⚡ Final **optimized approach**
- 🧪 **Edge case analysis** and thought clarity

Each problem folder = 📂 One learning story.

## 📌 Repository Goals

> Solve with thinking, not just coding.

🔹 **Learn DSA deeply**, one real problem at a time  
🔹 **Reflect and journal** my thought process  
🔹 **Avoid copying** — solve from scratch with my logic  
🔹 **Master problem patterns** via repetition and intuition  
🔹 **Prepare for interviews** through conceptual clarity and coding confidence

## 🚀 My Current Focus: Top Interview 150 on LeetCode

🎯 I’m solving problems from the [**Leetcode Top Interview List**](https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/) in the **same sequence as Apna College's DSA Playlist** to follow a structured roadmap.

## 📁 Structure of Each Problem Folder

Each problem I solve gets its own folder:

📂 /Problem-Name
┣ 📄 README.md ← My complete thought process, logic, mistakes & learnings
┗ 📄 index.js ← Final optimal solution (with clean code & comments)
